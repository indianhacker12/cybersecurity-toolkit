# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

A Python-based web application vulnerability scanner that helps identify common security vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Features

- SQL Injection detection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) detection
- Directory Traversal testing
- SSL/TLS configuration analysis
- Security Headers checking
- Comprehensive vulnerability reporting

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required packages:
  - requests
  - beautifulsoup4
  - urllib3

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Enter the target URL when prompted (e.g., http://testphp.vulnweb.com)

3. The scanner will perform various security checks and generate a detailed report including:
   - SQL Injection vulnerabilities
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - Directory traversal issues
   - SSL/TLS configuration problems
   - Missing security headers

## Security Tests Performed

### SQL Injection
- Tests multiple SQL injection payloads
- Detects SQL error messages
- Identifies potential database vulnerabilities

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Tests various XSS payloads
- Checks for payload reflection in responses
- Identifies vulnerable input fields

### Directory Traversal
- Tests path traversal sequences
- Checks for sensitive file access
- Identifies insufficient input validation

### SSL/TLS Analysis
- Certificate expiration checking
- SSL configuration verification
- HTTPS implementation testing

### Security Headers
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security
- Content-Security-Policy
